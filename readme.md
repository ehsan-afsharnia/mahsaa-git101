|:-------|:----------|
|**branch:**|branches are used to create another line of development.usually a branch is created to work on a new feature.|
|**commit:**|when we run git commit we save the changes in our working directory permenatlyin our git repository running commit is like taking a snap shot of our project.|
|**head:**|is a pointer which always point to the latest commit in the branch.|
|**pull:**| pull operations copies changes from a remote repository instance to a local one. it is used to for synchronization between two repository|
|**push:**|push operation copies changes from a local repository to remote one.|
|**merge:**|it join two or more more development history together. the merge command integratesthe integrate lines of development into a single branch.|
|**checkout:**|git checkout refers to the action of swaping between different repository branch or commits.|
|**fastforward:**|Fast forward merge can be performed when there is a direct linear path from the source branch to the target branch. In fast-forward merge, git simply moves the source branch pointer to the target branch pointer without creating an extra merge commit.|
|**fetch:**|The git fetch command downloads commits, files, and refs from a remote repository into your local repo. Fetching is what you do when you want to see what everybody else has been working on.|
|**remote:**|A remote in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes. In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like GitHub or on an internal server|
|**origin:**|In Git, "origin" is a shorthand name for the remote repository that a project was originally cloned from. More precisely, it is used instead of that original repository's URL - and thereby makes referencing much easier.|
|**up-stream/down-stream:**|The term upstream and downstream refers to the repository. Generally, upstream is from where you clone the repository, and downstream is any project that integrates your work with other works.|
|**repository:**|A Git repository is the . git/ folder inside a project. This repository tracks all changes made to files in your project, building a history over time. Meaning, if you delete the . git/ folder, then you delete your project's history.|
|**stach:**|git stash temporarily shelves (or stashes) changes you've made to your working copy so you can work on something else, and then come back and re-apply them later on. Stashing is handy if you need to quickly switch context and work on something else, but you're mid-way through a code change and aren't quite ready to commit.|
